storyforge2/merch/export_ingest.py -- load and validate a MerchPulse export.

A MerchPulse export is a single JSON object of entity_name -> list[record].
The records form a chain:

    TrendSignal -> Opportunity -> Concept -> Design -> Product -> Listing
                                                    \\-> Campaign -> PublishJob
                                                                 \\-> Order
                                                                 \\-> SalesMetric

This module does three jobs, in order of importance:

1. **Quarantine demo data.** Every entity carries `is_demo`. Seeded demo
   records are structurally identical to real ones, so anything downstream
   that publishes must be able to ask "is this real?" and get a hard answer.
   `real_campaigns()` is the only list a publish path may consume.

2. **Check referential integrity.** A dangling foreign key means the export
   is partial or the app wrote an orphan. Silently ingesting one produces a
   listing with no design, which is exactly the kind of failure that only
   shows up after it is public.

3. **Report reach, not just validity.** A trend with no Opportunity has never
   been acted on. Surfacing that is the difference between "the pipeline ran"
   and "the pipeline produced something".

Structural problems raise. Content observations are returned as findings --
they are judgements about the data, not proof it is broken.
