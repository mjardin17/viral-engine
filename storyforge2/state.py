"""
storyforge2/state.py — idempotent, resumable pipeline state ledger.

Same design as the SQLite stage ledger proven working in this session's
earlier empire-os work (AutomationStudio): every stage attempt records
its inputs, outputs, provider, status, timestamps, and error, so a run
is retryable without duplicating completed work, and any single asset
can be regenerated without rebuilding the whole project.

One project = one book. Stages run in a fixed order (STAGES below) but
each stage's *history* is append-only — regenerating a stage creates a
new StageRun row (higher attempt_number) rather than overwriting the
old one, so nothing is silently lost.
