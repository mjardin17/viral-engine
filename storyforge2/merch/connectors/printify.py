storyforge2/merch/connectors/printify.py -- Printify product creation.

Built as the fallback to Printful. The two vendors differ in four ways that
each have a failure mode, so this is not a copy of printful.py with the URL
swapped:

1. **Price is an integer of minor units, not a decimal string.** Printful
   takes "24.99"; Printify takes 2499. Sending 24.99 where cents are expected
   lists the product at 25 cents. This is the single most expensive mistake
   available in this file, so the conversion is one function with its own
   tests and rejects anything that would silently round.

2. **Everything is shop-scoped.** Products are created under
   /v1/shops/{shop_id}/products.json. An account with several shops has no
   default, so PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID is required, not optional.

3. **Artwork uploads first, separately.** POST /v1/uploads/images.json returns
   an image id, and the product references that id -- not the URL. Because
   that endpoint also accepts base64 `contents`, a **local raster file is
   submittable to Printify**, which is not true of Printful. Hence
   `accepts_local_upload = True`.

4. **blueprint_id + print_provider_id are required.** These identify the blank
   and who prints it. They are not derivable from a product type, so they are
   required arguments with no defaults -- a wrong blueprint prints the design
   on the wrong garment.

## Verification status

[Verified] Nothing. No PRINTIFY_API_KEY exists here, so no call below has been
run against a live account. The request shapes come from Printify's published
REST documentation and are [Likely]. As with Printful, a 2xx that does not
contain a recognisable product id is reported as a failure rather than as a
listing that may not exist.
