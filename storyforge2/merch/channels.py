"""
storyforge2/merch/channels.py -- honest capability registry for merch channels.

Reuses the book side's ConnectorStatus vocabulary unchanged, because the
distinction it encodes is the same one that matters here: a platform either
exposes a real submission API, gates that API behind business approval, or
requires a human at a web form. Print-on-demand does not change that shape.

Platform IDs are namespaced (`etsy_merch`, not `etsy_digital`) so this
registry can be merged with the book registry without an ID collision --
the two describe different product types on the same vendor.

Sourcing note: the POD API facts below come from Josh's own research pass
recorded in CLAUDE.md and are marked there as [Reported, not Certain]. They
are carried at that same confidence here -- `notes` says so per platform
rather than laundering a reported fact into a verified one. Confirm a
platform's endpoint before the first real call against it.
