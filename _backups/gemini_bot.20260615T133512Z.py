Generates a draft scene/shot list for the next LEGEND EMPIRE episode.

Contract:
  stdin  -> JSON: {"series_name": str, "episode_number": int, "topic": str}
  stdout -> JSON: {
      "series_name": str,
      "episode_number": int,
      "topic": str,
      "title": str,
      "scenes": [
          {
              "scene_number": int,
              "title": str,
              "description": str,
              "narration": str,

          },
          ...
      ],
      "source": "gemini-api" | "template-fallback"
  }

If GEMINI_API_KEY is set in the environment (or .env), attempts a real call
to the Gemini API to draft the scene list. On any failure (missing key,
network error, bad response), falls back to a deterministic template so the
pipeline always produces usable output.
