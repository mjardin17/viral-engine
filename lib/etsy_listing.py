"""Real Etsy listing creation via the Open API v3.

Etsy's create flow differs from eBay's in ways that matter:

1. **Request body is form-encoded, not JSON** — every value becomes a
   string on the wire, which sidesteps the float-repr hazard eBay's price
   handling has to guard against with Decimal (a JSON `24.99` can
   serialize as `24.990000000000002`; form-encoding never does).
2. **Draft-first, always.** ``createDraftListing`` cannot set the listing
   live — it always produces a ``draft``. Going live is a *separate*
   ``PATCH .../listings/{listing_id}`` with ``state=active``, which costs
   Etsy's per-listing fee. This module exposes that as a distinct,
   separately-gated step, not folded into creation.
3. **Images are binary uploads, not URLs.** eBay *pulls* images by URL;
   Etsy requires the file bytes via a separate
   ``POST .../listings/{listing_id}/images`` call per image, and returns
   an ``image_id`` used nowhere else. Fetching a remote URL to re-upload it
   is new SSRF surface eBay's path never had — restricted to https,
   redirects refused, response size capped.
4. **No idempotency on create.** eBay's inventory-item PUT replaces on
   retry; Etsy's ``createDraftListing`` is a POST with no idempotency key —
   calling it twice makes two drafts. This module never auto-retries a
   partial failure; ``EtsyListingError.listing_id`` is set whenever a draft
   already exists on Etsy's side, so a caller can resume instead of
   duplicating.

Field values verified against Etsy's own OpenAPI-derived parameter tables
(who_made/when_made enums, title character-set rule, is_supply optionality,
shippingProfileId's conditional requirement) — 2026-08-20. When Etsy last
touched createDraftListing is unknown to this module; the docstring on
``WHEN_MADE_VALUES`` explains the one field that is known to drift.

5. **Digital files are a third separately-gated upload step, not part of
   createDraftListing either.** Confirmed 2026-08-20 against
   gordonturner/etsy-open-api-client's ShopListingFileApi.md and Etsy's own
   Listings Tutorial: ``uploadListingFile`` is
   ``POST .../listings/{listing_id}/files``, multipart field name ``file``
   plus ``name`` (the buyer-visible filename) and ``rank``. Etsy's docs
   state explicitly that a file cannot be assigned at draft-creation time —
   same shape as images. who_made/when_made are required on ALL listing
   types, including ``download`` — confirmed via a real API example in a
   public etsy/open-api GitHub discussion, not assumed to carry over from
   the physical case. Etsy enforces a 20MB-per-file, 5-files-per-listing
   cap (from Etsy's seller help docs, not the API schema — a platform
   limit, not a request-validation rule, so a request that violates it may
   still round-trip a 200 before failing elsewhere in Etsy's pipeline).

⚠ Not yet exercised against a live Etsy account — no ETSY_REFRESH_TOKEN
exists in this repo yet (see CHANNEL_SETUP.md). Field names and the call
sequence are [Likely], verified against documentation, not a live request.
The payload builders are pure functions specifically so they can be diffed
against a real request once credentials exist — same reasoning as
lib/ebay_listing.py.

Auth: OAuth 2.0 + PKCE, an access token with the ``listings_w`` scope
(``listings_r``/``shops_r`` also needed elsewhere in this app for reads).
Etsy's PKCE flow has no client secret at the token-exchange step — do not
assume ETSY_SHARED_SECRET is used the same way EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET is.
